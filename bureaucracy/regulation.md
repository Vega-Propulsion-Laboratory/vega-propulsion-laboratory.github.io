This may sound extreme, but for almost every regulation, there was someone that
did such a thing before the regulation existed and either hurt themselves,
or someone else to the point where a regulatory authority saw fit to
make such actions regulated.

This reason is why we as a community do not encourage building your own rocket
motors. There are so many regulations due to the dangerous nature of building a
rocker motor.

## Starting rocketry

When getting into rocketry, there are a lot of rules to know to ensure that you
are flying safely and responsibly. These rules exist to protect others but also
yourself. Getting aquatinted with the local laws and regulations is **highly**
advised if not mandatory.

## Regulatory Bodies

**DISCLAIMER:**
We are not lawyers and this list is not kept up to date. The links here are meant
to be a starting point or point you in the right direction.

If your region is not in this list, reach out to a [local student rocketry team][student-rocketry]
or a local rocketry club &mdash; which you can find using the [NAR Club Locator][nar-club-locator]
if you are in the US &mdash; for information regarding your local regulatory bodies
and please [edit this page on GitHub][edit] so your region can be added.

### USA

-   [National Fire Protection Association][nfpa] - Many states and towns base
    their local laws off of codes provided by this association. It is important
    to still know local safety codes, since they may differ slightly from
    these.
    -   [NFPA Code 1122][nfpa-1122] - Code for Model Rocketry
    -   [NFPA Code 1127][nfpa-1127] - Code for High Power Rocketry
-   [NAR] - While not specifically a regulatory body, they are a lobby for model
    rocketry, helping standardize rocketry legislation across the USA. Their
    [Model Rocket Safety Codes][nar-safety-code] lay out an abridged version of
    the same information in the NFPA codes above in more layman's terms. Although
    this is a good reference, **always** consult your local authorities and abide
    by your local legislation.
-   [Tripoli] - Is very similar to the NAR in their safety codes which can be found
    [on their website][tripoli-codes]
